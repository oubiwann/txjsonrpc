Examples
--------

In the top-level source directory for txJSON-RPC, there is an examples
directory.  This contains the following:

* Client and server examples for twisted.web-based JSON-RPC.

* Client and server examples for Netstring TCP JSON-RPC as well as code shoing
  how to use subhandlers for the TCP code, since this differs from the
  XML-RPC/JSON-RPC HTTP-based subhandlers.

Examining each of the Python files in the example directories is the best way
to get a sense of how to use txJSON-RPC.
