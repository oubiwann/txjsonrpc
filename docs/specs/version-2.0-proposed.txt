=====================
Version 2.0, Proposed
=====================


Request
-------

A remote procedure call is made by sending a Request to a remote service. The
Request is expressed as a single JSON Object, with the following members:

* jsonrpc - A String specifying the version of the JSON-RPC protocol. MUST
  be exactly "2.0". If jsonrpc is missing, the server MAY handle the
  Request as JSON-RPC V1.0-Request.

* method - A String containing the name of the procedure to be invoked.
  Procedure names that begin with the word rpc followed by a period
  character (U+002E or ASCII 46) are reserved for rpc-internal methods and
  extensions and MUST NOT be used for anything else.

* params - An Array or Object, that holds the actual parameter values for
  the invocation of the procedure. Can be omitted if empty.

* id - A Request identifier that MUST be a JSON scalar (String, Number,
  True, False), but SHOULD normally not be Null [1], and Numbers SHOULD NOT
  contain fractional parts [2].  If omitted, the Request is a Notification.
  This id can be used to correlate a Response with its Request. The server
  MUST reply with the same value. Due to the nature of callbacks in
  Twisted, this property is not needed nor used by txJSON-RPC.  In the
  version 2.0 spec, it is provided for the sake of compatibility.

The following imported function is not public and not intended for regular use
as part of the API. Its use here is for spec-compliance demonstration only::

    >>> from txjsonrpc.jsonrpclib import ServerProxy, VERSION_2
    >>>
    >>> proxy = ServerProxy("http://some.url", version=VERSION_2)
    >>> proxy._getVersionedRequest("myfunc", ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"], "anid")
    '{"params": ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"], "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "myfunc", "id": "anid"}'

# XXX add async examples for web, web2, and netstring
# XXX add named parameter support example for each as well
